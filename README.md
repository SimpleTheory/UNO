# UNO
Text Based UNO Game

Made this because I wanted to challenge myself, it's not amazing, but I am really proud of myself over how much I have accomplished and my improvement in python as I incorparted and learned many new things in this project.



The way to play is pretty intuitive, just run main and you'll see.



Starting deck is an init routine for the game, it generates the game scenario.

Subroutine is a subroutine file for all files.

Turn operator is where turn based functions are located, as well as the main turn fxs (user_turn) (ai_turn) are stored.

Main is the game, the meta flow of it from pre-game to upkeep, main, end, post-game phases.
